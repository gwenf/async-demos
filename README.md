1. Clone your fork
1. Create a new file in the demos repo with your name or nickname (demos/[name].js)

## Coding Steps inside the file you just created

1. Move into the `demos/` folder: `cd demos`
1. Install a library for API calls, request or axios: `npm install axios` or `npm install request`
1. Make a call to the Github API (e.g. https://api.github.com/users/gwenf/repos, full API is at https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/available-endpoints/)
1. Try chaining .then() and .catch() onto the Promises
1. Now create an async function and make the call using await syntax
1. Try out different endpoints and print out your results

## AFTER

1. Write your code & add/commit/push your changes to your forked repo
1. Make a PR back to the original repo: `gwenf/async-demos`
